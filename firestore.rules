/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for the image uploading application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and images.
 * Only authenticated users can create, update, or delete their own profiles and images.
 * Additionally, it supports an admin role based on document existence in the `/roles_admin` collection.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - `/users/{userId}`: Stores user profile data.
 * - `/users/{userId}/images/{imageId}`: Stores images associated with a specific user.
 * - `/roles_admin/{adminId}`: Documents representing admin users.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only manage their own profiles and images.
 * - Admin privileges are granted based on the presence of a user ID in the `/roles_admin` collection.
 * - Listing all users is disallowed.
 * - No data schema validation is enforced in this prototyping phase except for relational integrity.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Path-based ownership is used for images, eliminating the need for denormalized `ownerId` fields within the image documents themselves. The `userId` path parameter inherently represents the owner.
