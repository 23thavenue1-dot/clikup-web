/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for Image Uploading Application
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for images and notes,
 * ensuring that only authenticated users can access their own data.
 * Additionally, it provides a mechanism for granting admin privileges.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - Users: `/users/{userId}` stores user profile information.
 * - Images: `/users/{userId}/images/{imageId}` stores image data associated with a user.
 * - Notes: `/users/{userId}/notes/{noteId}` stores user's notes.
 * - Admins: `/roles_admin/{adminId}` stores admin role, the mere existence of this doc grants admin permissions.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own user documents.
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete images associated with their own user ID.
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete notes associated with their own user ID.
 * - Listing images and notes is restricted to the owner.
 * - Admin privileges are granted to users who have a document in the `/roles_admin/{adminId}` collection.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `userId` is embedded in the path for both images and notes,
 *   allowing us to easily check ownership without additional `get()` calls.
